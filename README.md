# Workstation Setup

This project automates the process of setting up a new Mac OS X based development machine using a simple [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) script.

It was inspired by work done on [Pivotal Labs' Workstation Setup](https://github.com/pivotal/workstation-setup), which has been open sourced to be used and modified by anyone.

I created this fork of that project because the Pivotal Workstation Setup is very opinionated on configuration settings and will **override** certain configurations (e.g. my `vim` configurations)


## Pre-Requisites

In order to use this, you will need:
 
* To be running [Mac OS X El Capitan](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/os-x-el-capitan/id1018109117)
* To have an account with [`sudo`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo) access


## Installation

To install, simply open up the OS X Terminal and run the following commands:
 
```
mkdir -p ~/workspace
cd ~/workspace
git clone https://github.com/rmkiriako/workstation-setup-mac.git
cd workstation-setup-mac
./setup.sh
```

**IMPORTANT:**

* While all of this is mostly automated, you will get prompted for your password several times, so hang around and keep an eye on the screen.


## Post Installation

After you complete the installation, you will need to do some manual tasks to get everything working correctly.
